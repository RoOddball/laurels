## Vocabulary
member: The Laurel active volunteer

## Required Properties
### 1. Accessible
1.1 Can be fetched and viewed at any time.
1.2 Can be fetched by any member without:
    1 unreasonable (comparable to the effort necessary to generate the proof) additional effort.
    2 payment of any sort.
    3 adhering to NDAs or other constrictive rules.
1.3 Phone browser fetchable/viewable.
### 2. Readable
2.1 Legible: if in other formats than text: easily readable of the whole proofing content.
2.2 Is in English or correctly-translatable by automated services (google translate).
### 3. Traceable
3.1 a valid link (or path) between the proof and the effort output and the proof exists.
3.2 a valid link (or path) between the effort output and the member name exists.
3.3 the identity of the member is bindable to his/her member name.
### 4. Reasonable
4.1 The effort that the proofs represent is of the same nature as the claimed laurels
4.2 The effort that the proofs represent is of the same quantity as the claimed laurels. (The test here is: can this particular effort be done by somebody else much faster?)
4.3 It is obviously in the benefit of The Laurel, or the volunteers in general, or approved by your ancestor or effort organizer.
