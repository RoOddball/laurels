# Tentative Volunteers Setup

## Intro

@tentative volunteer: 
A short intro on how The Laurel works now for tasks and claiming:
When you register in the system, you get 10 marketing laurels (ML) that you can use to either claim a task rewarded with marketing laurels or create your own task, that someone else can claim. Or, you can claim it yourself, in order to start the dharma wheel.
If a task is worth 5 ML, then the organizer's balance is subtracted 5 ML and placed in escrow (to be retracted if the claim is challenged by other volunteers). The person who claims the task will also have 5 ML subtracted from his current balance. At the moment, 2* task amount is enough to award the claimer the reward in the same transaction. So, you will see the claimer's primordial balance increase.
To use this primordial balance, you need to pump! (transform it into a current balance). When you pump, your ancestor is rewarded and your balance is multiplied by (at the moment) a factor of 2.

### Setup has 3 steps:

- create accounts
- earn your first Laurels
- monitor/propose additional tasks

In the first 2 days, you are expected to complete Step 1 -> 3 and get your first laurels. If you need help with any of the steps, ask in this channel.

This is where you get ready for any higher level of access, including sympathizer. Once you complete 3h of volunteering, your role will be upgraded to @sympathizer. You have 1 week. Good Luck!


## Step 1 - Create the Necessary Accounts.
1. Create a GitHub account if you do not have one: https://github.com/
2. If you do not already have a browser wallet for Ethereum: install Metamask as a browser extension: https://metamask.io/download.html and create a wallet. We will only use a test network for The Laurel - currently Rinkeby. Choose one of the created Ethereum addresses (looks like 0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906) to use with The Laurel.
3. Add your information, that will appear publicly on our social media bots. Create a Pull Request with: 
  a) edit https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json and add your chosen Ethereum address and your name or nickname
  b) add an avatar here https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/tree/main/data/images. The file title must be your Ethereum address, like 0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906.png
If you do not know how to create a Pull Request: while logged into GitHub, click on the edit button from https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json. This will fork the project on your account and you can start editing. Commit your changes to master. Upload your avatar. You will see a create Pull Request button under the "Contribute" dropdown - click on it.
4. Get Rinkeby testnet ETH from https://www.ethily.io/rinkeby-faucet, https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ or similar faucets.
5. Optionally follow https://twitter.com/provable_laurel, https://www.facebook.com/The-Laurel-Project-688583115349973 and create a https://www.reddit.com/ account if you don't have one yet.


## Step 2 - Get your first Laurels.
1. Ask another volunteer to be your ancestor in the system and register you (provide your Ethereum address).
2. You will get 10 Marketing laurels (equivalent to 10 minutes of volunteer effort) when you are registered. This will help you claim your first task.
3. Your first task can be: 
    a) Retweet 5 tweets from @provable_laurel or another volunteer's tweets that are related to The Laurel and the technical projects developed under The Laurel (e.g. @lorecirstea).
    b) write a social media post (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Linkedin) saying what inspired you to join The Laurel and what your expectations/hopes are. We expect it to be honest and factually correct.
    c) you propose your own idea for a task that is compatible with the above
4. If your ancestor approves it, he/she will register this task for you in the system and give you the link for claiming. 
5. Claim the task and you will be awarded with laurels.


## Step 3 - Search, Monitor or Propose Tasks. Then perform them. Repeat. You are part of The Laurel.
Search in https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/issues for other tasks, from any organizer.
If you do not find a task that you can do, ask in the channel.


## Aftermath
After the first week and/or accumulating the necessary Laurels for your level of involvement, you will have access to the corresponding repos and Discord channels.
